### mope_illustrator
`mope_illustrator.h` strives to be a header-only, barebones game engine. I am making this for my own benefit; it is heavily inspired and informed by OneLoneCoder's [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine). This project is very much in its infancy: it still has some bugs to work out, and doesn't include nearly as many features as are planned.

Requirements:
- https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h
- [mope_vec](https://github.com/mope-life/mope_vec) (included as a submodule)

### actual documentation forthcoming
